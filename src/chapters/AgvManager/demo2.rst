Demo 02: Drag and drop example with loading and loading operations
*******************************************************************

In this example we will see how we can perform a drag and drop to a user point. A user point represent a working station, that could be machine or simply a position in a store. For example in an automatic store, a user point may represent the position where materials can be stoked or picked. A user point have a property called ``bPresenza`` that indicate the presence of material in the position designated by the user point or its absence.
